First build paintown in nacl mode (read doc/nacl)

$ ln -s ../../../paintown paintown-32.nexe
# or name it paintown-64.nexe if you are on a 64-bit machine
$ ln -s ../../../data .
$ ./httpd.py
# navigate your browser to http://localhost:5103/paintown.html

You should see the word 'Paintown!'. Wait for a second while the executable loads
and then a 'Run' button should appear. Click that to run Paintown.

Make sure the data/ directory has 'directory.txt' in each of its subdirectories. Use
misc/nacl-directories to produce 'directory.txt' for all subdirectories.

paintown.nmf is for chrome 13
paintown.nmf.14 is for chrome 14
