Run valgrind on load with leak-checking enabled

$ valgrind --leak-check=full build/test/mugen/load

It should take about 8 minutes to complete.

Expected output should say something about 0 errors and 0 bytes in use at exit:

$ valgrind --leak-check=full build/test/mugen/load
  ...
  ==32434== 
  ==32434== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 57 from 1)
  ==32434== malloc/free: in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
  ==32434== malloc/free: 2,925,707 allocs, 2,925,707 frees, 178,751,209 bytes allocated.
  ==32434== For counts of detected errors, rerun with: -v
  ==32434== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible.
