* How to build for Google's Native Client:
*  This assumes you are on linux (you can modify it for windows as necessary)
*  You can go to http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/docs/download.html and download the appropriate bin for your OS
*  
*  - To install naclports you need a version of the 'patch' program at least 2.6.1 - grab it here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch

  1. Download and setup the Native Client toolchain:
      $ wget http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/naclsdk_linux.tgz
      $ tar xvf naclsdk_linux.tgz
      $ mv native_client_sdk_* /opt/nacl_sdk
      $ export PATH=/opt/nacl_sdk/toolchain/linux_x86/bin:"$PATH"
  
  2. Setup chrome depot tools and nacl ports. Building the ports can take a while.
      $ export NACL_SDK_ROOT=/opt/nacl_sdk
      $ svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools
      $ mv depot_tools /opt/nacl_sdk
      $ export PATH=/opt/nacl_sdk/depot_tools:"$PATH"
      $ mkdir /opt/nacl_sdk/naclports
      $ cd /opt/nacl_sdk/naclports
      $ gclient config http://naclports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src
      $ gclient sync
      $ cd src/packages
      $ make
      # Build 64-bit packages as well (or change to 32 if needed)
      $ NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=64 make
  
  3. Set the build type environment variable to 'nacl' and build paintown by default it will detect whether your system is 32-bit or 64-bit
      $ export nacl=1
      $ cd /path/to/paintown
      $ make
      
  4. (* Optional) If you need to build for a specific architecture then you can override the architecture by setting one of the two items below
      - For 32-bit override: $ export nacl_32=1
      - For 64-bit override: $ export nacl_64=1

  5. Make directory listings for each directory that might be searched by paintown (like data/players).
    $ ls > directory.txt

    Make sure there are no extra classifier characters. Maybe use \ls if its aliased.

  6. Test it with the stuff in src/test/nacl
