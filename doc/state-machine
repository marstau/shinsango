* Describe the state machine used in paintown here *

States should consist of strings: 'walk', 'stand', etc.
Any internal states should be prefixed with 'paintown:', such as
  'paintown:fall', 'paintown:die'

When errors are reported due to missing states, use levenshtein distance to find
the closest matching state to avoid common spelling mistakes.

The state machine will be a prioritized NFA where each state can transition to multiple
other states but those states will be arranged in a total order such that a single
unique state can always be chosen.

Can states be heirarchical? All ground moves could be in the 'ground' state and then
even if the character is doing a move, any other character only has to test for the
'ground' state instead of enumerating all possible states. States could be specified
using paths, where parts farther to the left are parents.
